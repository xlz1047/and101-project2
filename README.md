# AND101 Project 2 - Kotlin Debug-a-thon

Submitted by: **Xin Zheng**

Time spent: **1** hours spent in total

## Summary

Debug-a-thon App is an android app that was riddled with some pretty nasty Kotlin bugs. With those gone, it's a collection of fun widgets for a variety of purposes! It now runs smoothly and shows how different small activities can be connected into one app experience.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: 🐞🔧📱

## Notes

This project helped me get more comfortable with debugging Kotlin errors, understanding activity navigation, and fixing small logic mistakes. I also learned the importance of carefully checking XML layouts and Kotlin code to ensure everything connects smoothly.
